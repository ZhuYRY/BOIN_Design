## Objective      
Replication of Bayesian Optimal Interval Design: A Simple and Well-Performing Design for Phase I Oncology Trials by Yuan et al.

## Simulation setting         
- 5 Dose levels;  
- Max sample size: 30 patients;     
- Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) rate: 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%;    
- For each DLT, 16 toxicity scenarios (location of MTD and gaps around MTD);        
- Under each scenario (see ToxicityScenarios_DLTrates.xlsx), do 10,000 trails.

### - Traditional 3+3         
- Dose level 1: $A\ B\ C$ (Cohort 1)       
  - 0 DLT (0 out of 3): $D\ E\ F$ at Dose level 2;       
  - 1 DLT (1 out of 3): $D\ E\ F$ at Dose level 1;         
    - 0 DLT (1 out of 6):  $G\ H\ I$ at Dose level 2.        
- IF >1 DLT out of 3 or 6 THEN Current dose level ($Dose_{i}$) > MTD:       
  - IF less than 6 patients have already been at $Dose_{i-1}$, THEN add a cohort of 3 at $Dose_{i-1}$;      
  - IF 6 patients have already been at $Dose_{i-1}$, THEN $Dose_{i-1}=MTD$;      
  - IF $Dose_{i-1} = Dose_1$, THEN the trial is terminated and the MTD is not found.     
- Remaining patients are considered treated at the selected MTD.
